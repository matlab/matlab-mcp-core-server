This server provides tools to inspect, analyze, run, and test MATLAB code using a locally installed MATLAB instance. The MATLAB desktop is visible to the user. Graphical output appears within the MATLAB UI.

Available tools:

- List installed MATLAB toolboxes and versions.
- Statically analyze a MATLAB .m script.
- Execute inline MATLAB commands.
- Execute a MATLAB .m script file.
- Run a MATLAB test script.

Available resources:

- guidelines://coding. Provides comprehensive MATLAB coding standards for improving code readability, maintainability, and collaboration. The guidelines encompass naming conventions, formatting, commenting, performance optimization, and error handling.
- guidelines://plain-text-live-code. Provides rules and guidelines for generating MATLAB Live Scripts using using plain text Live Code .m format, suitable for version control and AI-assisted development. Requires MATLAB R2025a or newer.

Best practices and safety:

- Always inspect tool outputs and catch errors. If execution fails, ask the user for clarification.
- Do not run untrusted code that could alter the file system or environment settings, without explicit consent from the user.
